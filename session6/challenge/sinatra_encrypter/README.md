## Sinatra Encryption Web App ##

This repo contains the source code for a simple sinatra web app, build to meet challenge six in ruby kickstart.

The app mimics the functionality of a caesar cipher: the user posts a message to the app
and they are returned a message encrypted by substitution (shift factor: 3). Users can also decrypt messages.
